Clone of Double Drift

This is a main mechanic clone project of Double Drift. In this project i've tried to make car's movement mechanic. This mechanic has implemented in 2 different type. 
There is 2 different scene in project. First scene named "GameplayTransform" and second scene named "GameplayPhysics".
In this first scene i've made car's movement with transform and in second scene i've made movement with car physics.
You can find player car, AI and spawner related data in a folder. Assets/Development/Resources/ScriptableObjects.
In first scene i've completed the mechanic. In the remaining time, I tried to make the mechanics of the car using physics. In GameplayPhysics scene car mechanic works but it's not completed.
I tried to maintain order in the project in terms of code layout and project structure.
